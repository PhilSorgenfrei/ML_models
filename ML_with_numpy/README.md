# ML_with_numpy

This repository uses the Titanic dataset from kaggle to train and test a numpy deep neural network. The model is heavily inspired by (and indeed is mostly a generalization of) numpy building blocks introduced by Andrew Ng in his excellent deep learning specialization course (https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

The "Numpy_model" folder contains the following: 
- Titanic_data.ipynb: Data exploration and pre-processing 
- Titanic_data.py: Implementation of data pre-processing in raw python 
- helpers_np_model.ipynb: Helper functions for the actual ML model 
- Titanic_np_model.ipynb: Model function integrating the data pre-processing and helper functions. This notebook also runs the model and reports on the output

In case there are any issues with displaying the notebooks through github, copy/paste the notebook url into nbviewer (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
