# tensorflow_notes

This repository contains tensorflow models I have written as part of my own education on the subject of machine learning. I am using jupyter notebooks and have tried to make them quite verbose to explain each step in a way that does not assume deep expertise of the subject itself or its implementation. I am not trying to maximize performance of the models, but rather use small datasets and little hyperparameter tuning just for the proof of concept and fast iterations.  

My hope is that somebody might find some of the content useful to progress their own journey in machine learning. 

Since this repositiory does not cover much of the underlying theory of machine learning, I am also working on some notebooks that cover topics such as activation functions, loss functions, or parameter initialization: https://github.com/PhilSorgenfrei/ML_notes 

For those who are just beginning to learn more about machine learning, I can wholeheartedly recommended the following resources: 

- CS50, Introduction to Computer Science (Harvardx): This course is excellent for all those who want to learn programming (or those who were always curious about the difference between linked lists, hash tables, and tries;) 
- deeplearning.ai (coursera, Andrew Ng): Andrew does a phenomenal job in teaching neural networks starting with the most basic calculus and linear algebra. I believe there is nothing more informative than implementing forward and backprop in raw numpy and I have him to thank for making the topic so very accessible. There is also no shortage of more practical concepts (especially hyperparameter tuning) and more complex and recent model architctures (LSTMs come particularly to mind)
- Andrej Karpathy's blog (https://medium.com/@karpathy): This apparently happens when somebody who knows a topic deeply takes the time to explain it to the rest of us - pure gold! 

If any mistake is spotted in these notebooks, please let me know so that I may fit it!
